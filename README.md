Project: Supermarket Sales Performance Dashboard
Project Overview:
In this one-week project, i created an interactive sales performance dashboard using
Power BI. The goal was to analyze and visualize the sales data to derive insights and help the
supermarket make data-driven decisions.


1. Download the Supermarket Sales dataset.
2. Import the dataset into Power BI.
3. Perform data cleaning tasks, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and
ensuring data types are correct.
4. Create a data model by defining relationships between tables (e.g., Sales, Products,
Customers).
5. Define appropriate hierarchies (e.g., date hierarchy).
6. Create calculated columns or measures for key metrics (e.g., Total Sales, Profit).
7. Design a dashboard layout with relevant visuals:
- Sales over time (line chart or area chart).
- Product categories (bar chart).
- Customer types (pie chart).
- Gender distribution (donut chart).
8. Add advanced visuals to your dashboard:
- Sales by branch and city (map or filled map).
- Customer rating distribution (histogram or box plot).
- Cost of goods sold (COGS) vs. Gross Income (scatter plot).
